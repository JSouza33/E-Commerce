# E-Commerce

An E-commerce project I built using React.js for frontend, Commerce.js for the backened and Stripe for payment processing. Users can add items on the main page to their cart and review their cart with the calculated subtotal. After navigating to the checkout, users are brought to the checkout page with a stepper that walks them through the address form, the card input for payment and lastly a confirmation page detailing the payment success.

# Dependencies

- Commerce.js
- React router
- Stripe
- Material.UI (for Icons)
